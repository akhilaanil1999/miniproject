        Hi There!
        
I’m Akhila, the cook, writer and photographer behind this little blog. I’ve grown up in the kitchen along side my mum and grandmothers and conversations in my family are always about the next meal. I’ve picked up their love for food along the way, and with this blog, I share my food story with you.
       
        This blog is for anyone who loves to cook and for everyone who doesn’t.

I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!
